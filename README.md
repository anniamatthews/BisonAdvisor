<h1>
  Remake of BisonAdvisor Project 
</h1>
<h3>Howard University Software Engineering Class, Fall 2023</h3>

<p>
  The original project was supposed to be a revamp of BisonWeb, HU's academic advising website. 
  My original intention for redoing this project was to practice my HTML and CSS,
  but then I remembered that this project was horribly procrastinated and would benefit from a total refurbishment.
</p>

<h3>The New Project</h3>

<p>
  I think I want to make it some sort of a 'career coach' type thing to honor the original project and things I wanted to implement. I practiced:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Authentication</li>
  <li>Form validation</li>
  <li>Navigation</li>
</ul>
<p>
  When first building it, and some of my stretch concepts included file upload/storage, and using the OpenAI API to create a chatbot type thing.
</p>

<h3>Tech Stack</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Google Firebase: </b>backend as a service</li>
  <li><b>Flask: </b>Python web framework for building server-side applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not sure what I want to keep or add to make it more functional. For now, the navigation works so I won't mess with it too much in the first iteration.</p>

<h3>Wireframes and Mockups</h3>
<p>TODO: create wireframes and figma mockups </p>
